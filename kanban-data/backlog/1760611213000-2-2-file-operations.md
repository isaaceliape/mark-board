# 2.2 File Operations

As a user, I want file actions to just work so that changes on the board are reflected on disk.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Read and write markdown files
- Move files between column folders on card move
- Delete files on card deletion
- Create files from a template and resolve naming conflicts
