## 2.2 File Operations (src/utils/fileOperations.ts)

As a user, I want file actions to just work so that changes on the board are reflected on disk.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Watches kanban-data/ add/change/unlink
- Debounces rapid events
- Updates store accordingly and cleans up watchers on unmount

## 3.1 Board Store (src/stores/boardStore.ts)

As a developer, I want a predictable store so that board state and actions are easy to maintain.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Card/Column interfaces defined
- Actions: loadCards, addCard, updateCard, moveCard, deleteCard, syncFromFileSystem
- Loading and error states exposed

## 4.1 Card Component (src/components/Card.tsx)

As a user, I want clear, informative cards so that I can scan and act quickly.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Shows title, preview, metadata badges
- Click-to-edit and delete with confirmation
- Tailwind styling and visible drag handle

As a user, I want an efficient editor so that I can update cards quickly.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Inline textarea editor with validation
- Metadata fields (tags, assignee, due date)
- Save/Cancel controls
- Live preview toggle and debounced autosave planned

## 4.3 Column Component (src/components/Column.tsx)

As a user, I want organized columns so that I can focus on my work state.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Header with title and card count
- Vertical list with empty state and drop styling
- New Card button

## 4.4 Board Component (src/components/Board.tsx)

As a user, I want a responsive board so that I can manage work comfortably.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Renders columns horizontally
- Drag-and-drop context and events integrated
- Loading spinner and error messages visible
- Sync status indicator planned

## 5.1 Drag & Drop Hook (src/hooks/useDragDrop.ts)

As a user, I want intuitive dragging so that moving work feels natural.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Sensors configured (mouse, touch, keyboard)
- Start/end callbacks implemented with optimistic UI and rollback
- Visual feedback during drag

## 5.2 Integration with File System

As a user, I want card moves to update files so that the board mirrors reality.

### Acceptance Criteria

- File moves reflect column changes
- Metadata updated after move
- Conflicts handled and concurrent operations prevented

## 6.1 Search & Filter

As a user, I want to find cards quickly so that I can focus on relevant work.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Search bar filters by title/content
- Filters by tags and assignee
- Clear filters button restores full view

## 6.2 Keyboard Shortcuts

As a power user, I want keyboard actions so that I can work faster.

### Acceptance Criteria

- 'n' creates new card
- 'e' edits selected card
