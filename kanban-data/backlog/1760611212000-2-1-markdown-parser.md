# 2.1 Markdown Parser

As a user, I want card content parsed from markdown with metadata so that information remains portable and human-readable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- YAML frontmatter parsed (title, tags, assignee, dueDate, created, updated)
- Markdown body extracted reliably
- Unique IDs derived from filenames
- Malformed markdown handled gracefully (warnings, fallback rendering)
