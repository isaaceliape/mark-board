# Unit Tests for Components

As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for the React components so that I can ensure the UI works correctly and prevent regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Test Card component rendering and interactions
- Test CardEditor component form handling and validation
- Test Column component card management
- Test Board component drag and drop functionality
- Mock store and file system dependencies
- Test user interactions (click, drag, etc.)
- Verify components render correctly with different props
- Test edge cases and error states
- Tests should be fast and not depend on actual file system
