# 2.0 Phase 2 Overview

As a developer, I want a clear overview of core utilities so that I can implement services consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Parsing, filesystem, and watching responsibilities separated
- Contracts and error handling approaches noted
- Not directly implementable; organizational reference only
