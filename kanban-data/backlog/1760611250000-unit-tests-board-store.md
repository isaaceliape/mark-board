# Unit Tests for Board Store

As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for the board store so that I can ensure the state management works correctly and prevent regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Test all store actions (loadCards, addCard, updateCard, moveCard, deleteCard)
- Mock file system operations to isolate store logic
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Verify state changes after each action
- Test the syncFromFileSystem function
- Ensure tests cover both success and failure scenarios
- Tests should be fast and not depend on actual file system
