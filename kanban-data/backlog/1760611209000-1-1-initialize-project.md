# 1.1 Initialize Project

As a developer, I want a clean, typed React setup so that I can build features quickly with a consistent toolchain.

## Acceptance Criteria

- React + TypeScript project scaffolded with Vite
- ESLint and Prettier configured with strict TypeScript settings
- Project structure created (src/, kanban-data/, etc.)
- Git initialized with appropriate .gitignore
- README contains setup and run instructions
