# Open Card Editor in Modal

As a user, I want the card editor to open in a modal overlay so that I can edit cards without losing context of the board.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Clicking edit on a card opens the CardEditor in a modal dialog
- Modal overlays the board with backdrop
- Modal is centered and responsive
- Save button updates the card and closes modal
- Cancel button discards changes and closes modal
- Modal can be closed by clicking outside or pressing Escape
- Keyboard navigation works within modal
