# Command Palette - Toggle Dark Theme Action

As a user, I want to toggle dark mode through the command palette so that I can quickly switch themes without using the UI button.

## User Story

Add a "Toggle Dark Theme" action to the command palette that allows users to switch between light and dark modes using keyboard shortcuts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Command palette includes "Toggle Dark Theme" action
- Action appears when searching for "dark", "theme", "light", or "toggle"
- Executing the action toggles the current theme (dark â†” light)
- Action shows current theme state in the label (e.g., "Toggle Dark Theme (currently: dark)")
- Works seamlessly with existing theme toggle button
- Theme state persists after toggling via command palette
- Keyboard-accessible (can be selected and executed via keyboard)

## Implementation Details

1. Update command palette hook/store to include theme toggle action
2. Import and use theme store methods
3. Add descriptive label that shows current theme state
4. Ensure action calls the same theme toggle function as the UI button
5. Add appropriate search keywords for discoverability

## Dependencies

- Existing theme store/context
- Existing command palette implementation

## Design Notes

The action should appear in the command palette list as:

```
ðŸŒ“ Toggle Dark Theme (currently: dark)
```

Or with an icon that matches the existing theme toggle button.
