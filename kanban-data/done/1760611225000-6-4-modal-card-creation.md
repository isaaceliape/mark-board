# 6.4 Modal Card Creation

As a user, I want to create cards in a modal so that the interface remains clean and consistent.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Clicking "New Card" button opens a modal with CardEditor
- Modal allows setting title, content, tags, and assignee
- On save, creates card in the appropriate column
- On cancel, closes modal without creating card
- Modal matches the styling of the edit card modal
