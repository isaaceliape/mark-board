# 6.6 Command Palette Create Card Modal

As a user, I want the command palette "Create new card" option to open the modal so that I can set card details before creating.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Selecting "Create new card" from command palette opens the create card modal
- Modal allows setting title, content, tags, and assignee
- On save, creates card in backlog column
- On cancel, closes modal without creating card
- Maintains consistency with other command palette actions
