# 6.7 VIM Navigation Command Palette

As a VIM user, I want VIM-style navigation keys in the command palette so that I can navigate efficiently using familiar keyboard shortcuts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- 'j' key moves down to next command/card
- 'k' key moves up to previous command/card
- 'h' key goes back from card selection to command palette
- Enter key selects the current item
- Esc key closes the command palette
- VIM navigation works in both command list and card selection modes
- Maintains existing arrow key navigation as fallback
