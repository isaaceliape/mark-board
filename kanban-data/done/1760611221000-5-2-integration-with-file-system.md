# 5.2 Integration with File System

As a user, I want card moves to update files so that the board mirrors reality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Moving a card moves the markdown file to target folder
- Card metadata updated with new column
- Move failures handled gracefully; concurrent moves prevented
