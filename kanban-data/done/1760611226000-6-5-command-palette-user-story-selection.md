# 6.5 Command Palette User Story Selection

As a power user, I want to quickly open any user story from the command palette so that I can navigate and edit cards efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Command palette includes "Open card" option
- Selecting it shows a searchable list of all user stories
- Keyboard navigation with arrows and enter to select
- Selecting a user story opens its edit modal
- List shows card titles and column information
- Esc closes the user story selection list
